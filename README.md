# Emotion Classification ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜¢

A deep learning-based project to classify human facial expressions as **Happy** or **Sad** using image data.

## ðŸ§  Overview

This project uses a binary image classification model to predict emotions based on facial expressions. It leverages **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **OpenCV** for training, inference, and image handling. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled images of happy and sad faces, and it can predict emotions on new, unseen images.
